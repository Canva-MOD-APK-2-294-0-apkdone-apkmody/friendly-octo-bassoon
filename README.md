## Getting Started

**Friendly-Octo-Bassoon** allows you to get started quickly with its intuitive setup. Here’s how to create and manipulate sounds in your project:

### Step 1: Add a Sound Source

In **Unity**, go to the `Friendly-Octo-Bassoon` menu and select `Create New Sound Source`. Choose from various sound templates (Looping Sound, Triggered Sound, Reactive Sound).

### Step 2: Customize the Sound Properties

After adding a sound to your scene, you can adjust the following properties:
- **Pitch**: Adjust the pitch to create more unique sounds.
- **Volume**: Set the base volume level for your sound.
- **Reverb**: Add environmental reverb effects to match the setting (e.g., underwater, cavern).
- **Speed**: Modify the speed of the sound to match in-game events.

### Step 3: Real-Time Interaction

To make the sound interactive, you can bind it to specific in-game actions or events. For example, you can link a sound to player proximity, object interaction, or environmental triggers.

In **Unreal Engine**, use the Blueprint interface to trigger audio changes based on player movement, environmental changes, or events in your game.
